The ListPOR program (List Parser for Outlier Removal) can be used to read a file containing columns of grouped values and remove outlier values using Grubb's test.

### Description
The ListPOR program can be used to read a file containing columns of grouped values and remove outlier values using Grubb's test. Typically, the first column of the input file will contain key information (text or numbers) on which to group the data. The second column will contain the values to examine for outliers, examining the data by groups. If additional columns are present, they will be written to the output file along with the key and value columns. Alternatively, if you provide a file with only one column of data, then all of the values will be examined en masse and the outliers removed. A simple graphical user interface (GUI) is provided to allow the user to select the input file and set the processing options.
